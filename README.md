The osTicket Support Center is a web-based platform designed to help organizations manage customer support efficiently. It allows users customers to submit support tickets when they need help or are experiencing problems. These tickets are then handled by support agents who work to resolve the issues.
The support center acts as a central place where all communication between the customer and the support team is organized. Instead of using email or phone calls, users can log in to the support center, track the status of their tickets, and receive updates directly.

Right here is where our agents will be able to see the live and most recently sent tickets. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs.

Now, within the ticket agents can change and assign the proper SLAs for the tickets, as well as assign to certain departments and agents. In this case this would be a Sev-A level since customers are unable to access their payment methods and banking information which is very serious and crucial for businesses to have working properly.
